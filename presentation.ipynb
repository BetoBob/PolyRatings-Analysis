    "Polyratings is a relatively small website in terms of popularity given it's a review site specific to one school (a google search for \"Polyratings\" yields only 11,300 results). Therefore, it is understandable that the website does not come with a developer API. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to collect reviews, I created a web scraping function with Beautiful Soup, iterating through the Polyratings directory of teacher profiles and scraping each profile individually. The HTML was a bit messy, but the HTML structure of each page was fortunately consistent across each profile. So I scraped each line of HTML in the file and created an array of these lines, and used offsets (indexes) to collect the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class Information\n",
    "    - class (full name)\n",
    "    - subject abbreviation\n",
    "    - class number (or level, stored as an int)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review Information:\n",
    "    - the review contents (as a large string)\n",
    "    - the month of the review (string)\n",
    "    - the year of the review (as an int)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Student Information:\n",
    "    - grade in the class\n",
    "        - stored as a string (to account for credit/no credit/withdrawn classes)\n",
    "        - also stored as a float (gpa) with the corresponding grade points:\n",
    "            - A: 4.0\n",
    "            - B: 3.0\n",

    "            - D: 1.0\n",
    "            - F: 0.0\n",
    "            - Withdrawn/Credit/No Credit: Nan\n",
    "    - the reviewer’s academic standing (as an integer and string)\n",
    "        - Freshman: 0\n",
    "        - Sophomore: 1\n",
    "        - Junior: 2\n",
    "        - Senior: 3\n",
    "        - 5th/6th Year Senior: 4\n",
    "        - Graduate Student: 5\n",
    "    - major of student (is the class major required? is it for a G.E.)\n",

    "Some of the offsets were fixed, such as the teacher’s name and score (it remained the same across every html file). Others were variable depending on the amount of classes the teacher offered and the lengths or reviews. To collect this data from the page, I used delimiters to separate the content. For example, when reading a review in, I could tell if I reached the end of a review if the next line was the name of a class or the school standing of the next reviewer. \n",
