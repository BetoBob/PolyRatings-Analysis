    "## I. Purpose / Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "** What is Polyratings? (for the uninitiated) **\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyratings is a professor review platform for students attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. It’s similar to the website [RateMyProfessors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com) in that professors are given an overall score based on the class’s difficulty and how the material is presented, but differs by being more minimalistic (with less categories to rate teachers and no advertisements). The site has reviews dating back to June 1999 (a month after the creation of RateMyProfessors) and has been generating a consistent amount reviews since the mid 2000’s. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Is Polyratings Dead? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the last year, Polyratings has appeared to be dormant in terms of support by the moderators. The last significant change to the website occurred in 2016, introducing a new polished design. There however hasn’t been any significant updates to the website since this redesign. In fact, although users are still able to write reviews about existing professors, the site is no longer accepting new professor submissions. There is no way to contact the current moderators of the site, as the email for reporting bugs (errors@polyratings.com) appears to be down. These facors could have contributed to a lower amount of reviews around 2017.\n",

    "- [Discussion on the state of Polyratings (Last Week)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/8pn0t0/is_there_any_way_to_fix_polyratings/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyratings is far from dead despite the lack of moderator support. People still add new reviews to existing teacher profiles. There are even new tools, such as the Chrome extension [PassThePlebs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pass-the-plebs/mhglgbabaleaegjhdcmfffkaaklpmjog?hl=en) that take advantage of Polyratings' reviews to help students register for the classes they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the site doesn't become completely dormant, there needs to be greater support from the moderators. Polyratings is a student run website however, so moderation can be especially time consuming for a site dedicated to an ~20,000 undergraduate population. Moderation includes checking new professors requests as well as removing reviews that are spam or innapriopriate. So, for this data science project, I sought to create a machine learning model that would detect and flag bad reviews in order to streamline the moderating process. This model would use existing reviews as a basis for detecting reviews in a similar category.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Site Use Over Time **\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* Notice the spike of reviews written around late 2016. This was around the time that the website was redesigned (September 2016), which probably revitalized use of the site.\n",

    "## II. Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyratings is a relatively small website in terms of popularity given it's a review site specific to one school (a google search for \"Polyratings\" yields only 11,300 results). Therefore, it is understandable that the website does not come with a developer API. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to collect reviews, I created a web scraping function with Beautiful Soup, iterating through the Polyratings directory of teacher profiles and scraping each profile individually. The HTML was a bit messy, but the HTML structure of each page was fortunately consistent across each profile. So I scraped each line of HTML in the file and created an array of these lines, and used offsets (indexes) to collect the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class Information\n",
    "    - class (full name)\n",
    "    - subject abbreviation\n",
    "    - class number (or level, stored as an int)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Review Information:\n",
    "    - the review contents (as a large string)\n",
    "    - the month of the review (string)\n",
    "    - the year of the review (as an int)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Student Information:\n",
    "    - grade in the class\n",
    "        - stored as a string (to account for credit/no credit/withdrawn classes)\n",
    "        - also stored as a float (gpa) with the corresponding grade points:\n",
    "            - A: 4.0\n",
    "            - B: 3.0\n",

    "            - D: 1.0\n",
    "            - F: 0.0\n",
    "            - Withdrawn/Credit/No Credit: Nan\n",
    "    - the reviewer’s academic standing (as an integer and string)\n",
    "        - Freshman: 0\n",
    "        - Sophomore: 1\n",
    "        - Junior: 2\n",
    "        - Senior: 3\n",
    "        - 5th/6th Year Senior: 4\n",
    "        - Graduate Student: 5\n",

    "Some of the offsets were fixed, such as the teacher’s name and score (it remained the same across every html file). Others were variable depending on the amount of classes the teacher offered and the lengths or reviews. To collect this data from the page, I used delimiters to separate the content. For example, when reading a review in, I could tell if I reached the end of a review if the next line was the name of a class or the school standing of the next reviewer. \n",

Given that there are over 65,000 reviews, it would be nearly impossible (and impractical) to read and filter each review. Flagging tools could be implemented on the site to allow users to define reviews they feel are spam/un-useful, but in lieu of this information, I used KMeans clusters to determine review categories.\n",

Because there’s a signficant vocabulary of words across all of the reviews, I could not create a bag of words containing each review due to system constraints. So with trial and error, I was able to create a TF-IDF data frame from a random sample of 1/20th of the reviews from Polyratings (around ~3250 reviews with 6,349 unique words). Of the sample, these were the top 20 words used for the term frequencies count (TF) and TF IDF scores:\n",

It would have been a K-nearest neighbors machine learning model and it is summarized below.
