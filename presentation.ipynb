    "Within the last year, Polyratings has appeared to be dormant in terms of support by the moderators. The last significant change to the website occurred over a year ago, introducing a new polished design. There however hasn’t been any significant updates to the website since this redesign. In fact, although users are still able to write reviews about existing professors, the site is no longer accepting new professor submissions. There is no way to contact the current moderators of the site, as the email for reporting bugs (errors@polyratings.com) appears to be down.\n",

    "Polyratings is a relatively small website in terms of popularity given it's a review site specific to one school (a google search for \"Polyratings\" yields only 11,300 results). Therefore, it is understandable that the website does not come with a developer API. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to collect reviews, I created a web scraping function with Beautiful Soup, iterating through the Polyratings directory of teacher profiles and scraping each profile individually. The HTML was a bit messy, but the HTML structure of each page was fortunately consistent across each profile. So I scraped each line of HTML in the file and created an array of these lines, and used offsets (indexes) to collect the following information:\n",

    "- Class Information\n",

    "    - subject abbreviation\n",
    "    - class number (or level, stored as an int)\n",

    "- Review Information:\n",
    "    - the review contents (as a large string)\n",
    "    - the month of the review (string)\n",
    "    - the year of the review (as an int)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Student Information:\n",
    "    - grade in the class\n",
    "        - stored as a string (to account for credit/no credit/withdrawn classes)\n",

    "            - Withdrawn/Credit/No Credit: Nan\n",

    "Some of the offsets were fixed, such as the teacher’s name and score (it remained the same across every html file). Others were variable depending on the amount of classes the teacher offered and the lengths or reviews. To collect this data from the page, I used delimiters to separate the content. For example, when reading a review in, I could tell if I reached the end of a review if the next line was the name of a class or the school standing of the next reviewer. \n",
