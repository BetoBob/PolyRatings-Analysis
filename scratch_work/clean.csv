However, that being said, his tests never have anything that we didn't go over in class. In addition, he'll allow students to ask last-minute questions the day of a midterm before beginning, which is really great in case you weren't able to make his office hour and needed to ask him something important before the test.

It's obvious that he's masterful of the material and as he goes through his lectures you can tell that he's actually processing the material as he goes since he always catches his own mistakes when he makes them (which is pretty rare compared to most math teachers). While he's great at lecturing and is very kind to his students and is always willing to help, sometimes the lectures seem like giant walls of information that are a struggle to get through conceptually. Without going to his office hours or looking up different methods of working through problems and understanding the material, this would be a very challenging class. Calc 3 is a very difficult class and not everyone gets the concepts right away, but fortunately Van Eps is aware of this when you approach him during office hours or after class and finds more in-depth ways of explaining things if you ask him to do so. If he implemented the same explanations in his lectures as he did in office hours, he'd be a perfect math professor, in my opinion. Great guy, take him if you can!
