Professor Bissonnette is a decent professor.  She clearly explained concepts and if you didn't understand something completely, she would spend as much time with you until you understood it!  If I had taken advantage of her office hours more, I think I could have gotten an A in this class!

Professor Bissonnette is teaching a very hard course in BUS 214.  She conveys the concepts well, but she also zips through things leaving students puzzled.  She is very approachable and a very nice lady.  Her office hours should be utilized if a good grade is desired because sometimes the lectures get long and tedious.  Her grading scale is pretty fair.  65% of the grade is based on 2 midterms and a final and the other 35% is based on homework, class attendance and projects.  Overall, be prepared for a tough workload, but be prepared to work with someone who genuinely cares about your success.

Prof. Bissonnette is an adequate teacher.  Accounting is hard for most people, so it is a difficult class.  It requires a lot of time and understanding of concepts.  The required project is the same for all sections of the class.  Participation, finishing homewoek, and being in class are the keys to getting a decent grade in this class.  How good of a grade depends on your availability of time and effort.

Bissonett is a good teacher, although this class required a lot of work the text is EXCELENT at simply explaining things and I think the combination of Bissonett and the text made a class that could have been really difficult a lot simpler.  Make sure you do the homework, don't get behind and know your credit's and debits!! and the second you get the final project START!!  I started over a week early and was still up till five the day of the due date.

I liked having Michelle for BUS 214.  Although the 2 hour lectures (avoid the 6-8 PM timeslot) could get boring, it was still rather interesting (it's accounting, for the love).  She explained everything clearly, and collected homework randomly, so if you want an A you better do the work and go to class.  I would say this class was easier than I had expected, and now I understand how the whole "business" thing works.  Although some of the homework can take hours, you won't regret taking her.

Professor Bissonnette was a good teacher for this course.  Upon taking the class, it was clear that she cares about the success of her students.  Her tests reflected what was taught and were moderately difficult to difficult - not unreasonable though.  Do your homework though, because she calls on you at random for answers.  She is not harsh though if you get the answer wrong.  The homework is quite timestaking and I would reccommend getting an early start on it.  I had a few really late nights trying to finish the problems.  The material isn't really complex, instead the difficulties lie with the fact that to most of the students, the material is all new.  I would recommend her as a teacher for this class.  You won't get there and say to yourself, "what the hell have I gotten myself into."

If financial accounting sounds daunting, Mrs. Bissonette will quell your fears.  She makes it seem simple by being clear in lecture, utlilizing homework well, teaching in an effective interactive manner and giving fair tests.  The class does involve a lot of work, but she makes it worth it.

Mrs.Bissonette was a great teacher for this class. There is homework due everyday but the book is pretty easy to understand and she goes over it in class. There is two midterms, a quiz, and a final. Her questions are pretty fair, nothing tricky or too difficult. The only thing that sucks about this class is the comprehensive problem we have to do (all 214 classes do this though) which we get 2 weeks to complete a super difficult problem, so definitely start early so you can ask her questions on it. I highly reccommend her for this class.

This is a tough class.  There is tons of information which you have to keep straight.  If you have to take this class, take it with her!  She is a great teacher and really encourages student involvement.  She is great during her office hours and takes plenty of time during and outside of class to make sure her students are comfortable with the material.  It definitely helps to do all the homework and go to the classes.  Try to take this class during an easy quarter because it does require so much work and time.  There is a big project to do but it isn't that hard, just takes time.  Do yourself a favor and take this class her!!!

Shes a nice lady. I really didn't like the class. I'm definately not interested in this material, but Prof. Bissonnette did a good job introducing the class to accounting. I studied a lot for the midterms and always ended up getting lower then I hoped. The project took me hours to get finished, so give yourself lots of time to get it done. She has two midterms work 100pts each, one quiz 50pts, the huge project worth 50pts, and the final worth 150pts. The hardest part of the class was the project, just go to lectures and the material will stick.

It is true, taking professor Bissonnette for financial accounting is probably the hardest class you have to take.  I loved Bissonnette's class and it's hard to hate her because she is such an excellent teacher.  She does not curve AT ALL so whatever grade you receive is what you earned.  There are two midterms, a quiz (which is like 25 extremely hard multiple choice problems), a cummulative project, homework, and a final.  Very, very intense class and VERY VERY time consuming. If you really want to learn financial accounting i highly recommend professor Bissonnette because it's hard to find a professor that truly cares about her students.  One more advice: don't take stats 252 while taking this class, you will go nuts like i did!

Professor Bissonnette is such a nice lady and a really great teacher!  Yes, the class is hard, but she is very good at explaining the concepts and she is always willing to help you out.  The workload is heavy because she randomly collects the homework (so you have to do it) and the homework was really time consuming.  The final project (that all 214's have to do) takes forever but she will help you figure it out if you go to office hours.  The tests were fair and straightforward, as long as you go to class and do the homework, you can do well.  Overall, I highly recommend Prof. Bissonnette.  She is great!!

There is no in between with this teacher.  You'll either love her or hate her.  If you consider yourself to be very adept in picking up material from lecture and from the book -then you'll be OK.  If you take a little more time to study and review for your classes - you'll regret taking this teacher for accounting.

As someone else mentioned earlier, she is the nicest b*t*ch you'll ever meet.  Her lazy style of teaching may suffice for students that are fairly adept at picking the material up quickly but it sucks for the rest of us.  If you ask her how people do in her course she tells you that it is fairly spread out.  Thats not so bad, but when I asked her what she personally does to improve her course in order to try an improve her passing rate she said that she's been teaching the course the same way for the last few years.  In other words she does not care about trying to accomodate her mid to lower echelon students. If she did, she'd constantly be trying to improve her course, like other accounting professors I know.  Its no surprise that her courses have higher failure rates than other accounting professors.

Her tests are (department midterms) and there is a clear gap between what she teaches you and what is on the test.  They are difficult and the HW alone does not prepare you for midterms.

ALL in ALL I HATE HER AND SHE IS A NICE LAZY B*T*CH!

It's true she's a nice person but her grading is extremely unfair. If you miss just some multiple questions, you will probably miss A for that class.  Also She assigns too much homework, and I found this to be most problematic.  I just wonder if we really need to work on this subject that much...

I really recommend this teacher.  She is always willing to help students in office hours, gives points for homework and attendance and actually takes time to go over every homework problem until we understand.  Her lectures follow the book exactly so I got an A and only had to read a chapter every once in awhile.  Her tests are straight forward and nothing tricky.  Just pay close attention in class and you will do fine.  Everything she says should be noted and studied.

I was shocked to read some of the mean comments about Professor Bissonnette written below!!  They are NOT true, these people are just bitter because they couldn't handle the material (yes, it's hard, but she is sooo helpful!)  She was one of the best professors I've ever had; always willing to help, very clear in her lectures and expectations, and makes the class interesting.  You can do well as long as you study everything from the lecture and homework.  Some people were upset about her multiple choice counting for 2 points each on the test; it did make it easy to get a bad grade.  However, I made flashcards and they helped A LOT.  Plus there are no surprises, she sticks to the material she teaches in class.  Overall, a great professor, highly recommended!

accounting is a tough subject right off the bat, but she tends to rush it at the end of the quarter, which is bad. the stuff in the beginning is easy and she spends way too much time on it, leaving the tougher stuff with less time to cover before the last midterm and final. her grading of them is pretty tough too. out of 100 points, usually about 22 multiple choice, each worth 3 points each! so you miss 4 and there goes your A for that one.

I love her teaching methods.  Homework is assigned regularly.  She has two deck of cards--one with the letters of the alphabet and one with our names on it.  She randomly takes role every now and then (with the deck of our names). She randomly collects homework from those people with last names that start with the letters picked from the deck.  So the need for you to go is established--points are deducted if it's your unlucky day.  Her tests are straight forward. They include scantron and a few write-out problems.  There's a big project that is given to you to work on throughout the quarter so DO NOT PROCRASTINATE on this and take advantage of her office hours.  She's very fair and wants feedback from her students all the time.  The only variable in all this is the class mix.  If her students aren't participating in class, it's hard for her to be excited about the material.

Allright, some people probably don't like Bissonnette because she actually makes you learn the material. As someone trying to get a meaningful education , I found this quite useful. You have to go to class, do the homework, participate (she gets really pissed if you don't), and complete projects. You do all this, and you WILL learn a whole lot of relevent information needed for any successful business career. She's one of those teachers who makes you practice the stuff so much that by the time the test roles around, you don't even need to study that much. Of course, if you didn't participate in class...you're screwed. Good luck.

This was one of the best classes I have taken at Cal Poly, and Prof. Bissonnette is an outstanding instructor. She is very knowledgeable about accounting and makes the subject very interesting to study. She does assign and collect homework, however the homework is very reasonable and it's a good idea to do it anyway. Her tests are challenging, but most people agree that they fair and if you go to class and pay attention there is no reason you shouldn't be getting at least a "B."

She feels that she needs to spend tons of time on the easiest material in the course. Then, when finals are a week away, we do 2 chapters durring dead week!! the worst part of it is that she told us we were on our own for one of them because we ran out of time. Maybe she should stop telling so many lame general electric stories that only she thinks are funny. Her class is BORING!

Bissonnette was a good teacher who definately knew her accounting.  She did a very good job of going over everything clearly in class, so much so that i never even used the book, except for doing the homework which is assigned daily but is collected by her random pulling of names.  The tests are very comprehensive, but i didn't study at all for any and got B's all across.  If you study a little bit tests should be fine.  Lastly there is a project that everyone has to do which requires about 10 hours of work, but if you're taking bus 214 you have to do it regardless of the teacher, and bissonnette was really helpful outside of class so just don't wait until the last minute on that.

Mrs. Bissonnette is an awesome accounting teacher. Seriously. I know I only got a C in the class, but that is my own fault. Michelle really knows her accounting, and has a lot of real world experiences to help explain accounting better. She does assign homework but she picks random names to turn it in and I never got chose, so I never had to turn homework in. However, to giev you credit for the homework and make sure you did it she will randomly call on the people that didn't turn it in to answer the questions. Do the homework and read the material, it helps a lot! This class really isn't bad but if you hate being in class this isn't the one for you. She takes aways points from your grade if you don't show up or do your homework and she loves to use every last minute of class, it is very rare if you get out early.

She is a tough teacher for a dry subject, which is usually a deadly combination.  However, you learn a decent amount if you can stay awake, and while she may be difficult, she can communicate pretty clearly.  If you want to do well on the tests you pretty much have to sacrifice at least 3 or 4 hours the day before to go through the chapters and take detailed notes.  Also, doing the homework actually does help for the exams; even though the questions are multiple choice, some of them require you to do calculations or answer questions similar to homework problems.  She is pretty helpful in her office hours so utilize them if you can.  Overall, I'd recommend her, but just be ready for a lot of work.

If you aren't good at accounting I def recommend that you do some prep for this class. The tests (2 mids 1 final) are ridiculous and of course there's no curve. I'm not that great at aaccounting, but I felt that i understood the material quite well and studied for hours, but when it came to exam day, the questions were obscenely difficut. The two hours are brutally boring and sometimes almost impossible to stay awake. HW is fair, about once a week, but it is time consuming, however you rarely have to turn it in because she collects only a few randomly. She seems eager to help, but once in her office she's rude and vague, especially during the project!!! It's a group project that is tough and takes forever, so dont procrastinate. Also it's only 40 out 420 pts which is stupid for the amount of time and effort!! Basically shes an ok teacher I reccomend you take a better one, but if you can't you'll probably be able to pass this class.

Professor Bissonnette is a great professor for 214.  She is very straightforward, no busy work kind of professor.  There was a lot of coursework to do regularly which she collects randomly, and class participation is vital as she will randomly do attendance checks.  But she teaches the material so clearly, which is so important for learning the fundamentals of accounting, or else, accounting concentrations will be confused further along in their careers at Poly.  Shes so helpful in her office hours, so I recommend going!  Also, she gets really busy at office hours because she is SO helpful that there is usually a line! Anyways, take her if you can, especially if you enjoy accounting.  She's worth it!!

I liked this class. I think she is a great teacher, her lectures coincide perfecyly with the book, and she really strives to help students understand. Her examples might seem overly simplified and silly at times, but i guarantee you will remember them on the test, which is what her point was i think. she likes it when you give her feedback in class, if you don't, the lectures can get kind of boring. but she's a great teacher and i really recommend her. you have homework due on thursdays and it's kind of interesting how she gives you credit for it (i don't feel like typing it all out) but basically you should do it, it will help you learn anyways. the tests were what was expected i think, though i felt like i did a lot better on them than i actually did. the "game" project is really simple, as long as you pay attention in class. i think people made it harder than it was. anyways, she's a great teacher, some people think class was boring (and it can be at times) but it's a great class and you really understand the fundamentals of accounting after it.

The homework does take time, a lot of time, but it is worth it because if you just do the homework and read the chapters and go to class it is a cinch.  Each midterm I studied about 2-3 hours for and got a 94 and 98.  If you just follow the class and do the work the tests are a breeze and it is an easy A.

Bissonnette is a wonderful professor.  Not only did she present the material in a clear and concise manner, but she also genuinely cared about the students.  The class is based on hwk, midterms, and a cumulative final. Homework is graded on a credit/no credit basis, and she goes over everything in class very thoroughly.  The only downside to her class was that the homework assignments take alot of time.  The midterms are challenging, but if you study you should get at least a B.  I would reccommend Bissonnette to anyone, TAKE HER!

Professor Bissonnette was my favorite teacher this quarter. She teaches clearly and concisely and she really cares about us (her students). There were 3 online quizzes, 2 midterms and a final. Homework is turned in selectively each time it's due, so doing it will help you do well. I would have gotten an A, but I forgot about a midterm date and kinda messed up a little. She is there during office hours to talk about class and offers great advice for problems we have. I would love to take her again!

She is an adequate teacher for a course that is just very hard. Her course has 2 midterms and a final. ALL of which are very very very difficult. I bombed the first one which ended up being why I got a C in the class. The way she words the questions is very tricky and the first three chapters that are tested are tricky to grasp so study a lot for the midterm or else it will come back to bite you in the ass. Her final was also very difficult due to the fact that it was cumulative. 2 chapters were new and they took up half of the test. The other half was already tested on material. Overall, she was an okay teacher for a class that I had to put ALOT of effort in because the concepts were very difficult for me.

A professor who is professional, organized, and fair. She never wastes your time and details exactly what to expect of the class from day one. The all-multiple choice midterms and final are not easy, but if you pay attention in class, read the book, and spend a few hours studying before each exam there's no reason you can't earn an A. The overall workload is not bad at all and as long as you put some time and effort into this class the end result will be good.

Coming into this class everyone warned me how hard accounting was but Bissonnette made the course seem almost "easy". By "easy" I mean you can understand it as long as you put the time in to do the required work. She is very sweet and really cares about your learning and accounting. If you do the reading and homework and get help when you need it you really shouldn't struggle in the class. It is a very tedious subject and I couldn't image a better teacher for it.

Very boring class, but since accounting is a dry topic I wont place too much blame on her. However, she never made any attempt to engage the class.

Very good teacher. Accounting is not a very exciting subject and she holds you in class for the full 2 hours so by the end you do not pay attention. She gives homework which seems like a lot the first few chapters but by the end is not bad. She picks randomly who turns in the homework and if you don't turn it in that day that when she goes over it she might call on you to explain what you did. This is for attendance points. She gives 3 quizzes that were fair. They were 5 problems with each one being worth 2 points. The first midterm was pretty easy and the second one was a little challenging. The final was pretty difficult and I have had people who took her at different quarters say the same thing so really prepare for it. Great teacher for a boring subject.

From True Rater:
Mrs Bissonnette was a very good teacher. She is very friendly and convays the material really well. She randomly grades h.w. so i suggest you do it, besides if you can do the h.w. you will do fine on her tests. The tests were a lot more vocabulary and analizing than computations. She will let you reschedule one mid term if you need to. The class consists of two midterms and a final exam which is partially cummulative but mostly material from the third section. Be sure to spend a lot of time on chapter 3&4, if you know chapters 1-4, the rest will be easy.

Bissionette is a really great teacher.  I took her for BUS 214 and 215.  Her slides are really helpful, so I would recommend always printing them out before lecture.  Also reading the book is a must.  Definitely read the chapter before she lectures on it.  Overall, the class is alright.  I always dreaded going because she covers so much material in such a short amount of time.  She literally lectures for 2 hours straight and you can expect to just sit there silently taking notes (which drives me crazy).  Her tests are extremely difficult.  I felt like I was taking the freaking CPA exam when I took the final for BUS 215!  In both BUS 214 and 215, I went into the final with a low A- and my overall grade turned out to be a B, which was really frustrating.

Very boring class because all of it is powerpoints and going over homework. The tests are all multiple choice, which can be annoying but they are straight forward. She never posts grades up online and does not go over the quizzes very well after we took them. If you go to her office hours, she helps a little but overall I thought this class was boring. Everytime I email her my questions, she responds with answers that don't really answer my questions at all. I wish it looked like she cared more about her students. Then, maybe I'd want to go in to her class.

Boring class with homework every other class. Professor Bissonnette is overall a pretty good lecturer, but it's really obvious she doesn't give a crap about her students. She was also pretty unenthusiastic about the class, which made us somewhat unmotivated. She grades pretty fairly and midterm grades sits around B- average. Class structure was 2 midterms and a final, 3 quizzes, weekly homework, and lab problems. All multiple choice questions. She is somewhat intimidating, but not too bad overall. The class is easy to pass, but somewhat difficult to ace.

I've had Bissonnette for 215 and 320. While class can be a little dry sometimes, she has been the most fair and reasonable teacher I've ever had. 

Her tests are multiple choice, and based purely on what she lectured on in class. Some trick questions, but nothing that you wouldn't pick up on by attending lecture. 

She is extremely helpful in office hours, and usually makes an effort to have extra hours if the class seems to be struggling. 

Make sure to review her powerpoints and chapter outlines, which she posts on poly learn, and you will do fine.

Mrs. Bissonnette is a very below average teacher. She is a nice lady and knows her material but assigning homework assignments and then going over them is not teaching. The worst part is she assigns homework and then tells you the next day she won't go over it and that you should know it. I did well in 214 and 314 is a little tougher but I would definitely say I knew the material better than a C. Her tests are 25 multiple choice and if you get 3 wrong you already have a B. Since when did Accounting become multiple choice is what I want to know. Her good Polyratings are a direct result of her being a nice lady and she does show concern for students. This should not be misunderstood as good teaching though. She does not grade on a curve and the first midterm we had she said the average grade was a 77 but everyone around me had at best a high D. I even pulled a low B minus. I heard Iqbal is a cool teacher and way easier so I would suggest taking him if you want a good grade.

She is one of the best professors Ive had here at poly.  She took an entire chapter out of the class because she noticed people were not keeping up.  Tax can be tough because there are alot of exceptions to the rules, but she tries to back everything up with an example that you can relate to.  I recommend taking tax with Michelle.  Two midterms and one final, one big tax return problem and one smaller one that you can work on in groups.  This is a class that even if its not your concentration, it may be a good idea to take to save some money later in life, very practical.

Professor Bissonnette is a very nice lady but a hardass at the same time. She cares about her students but doesn't give a shit for excuses or laziness, which is a good thing to an extent. If a vast majority of students do terrible on question on a test (she writes) she will not admit fault. Nevertheless, she's is more than happy to help you during office hours. It was her first quarter teaching Tax, which is a pretty difficult class, so maybe thats why a lot of students didn't do well. Finally, don't worry about taking her just make sure you get your shit done, she doesn't care if you don't and will not hold your hand.

Two Midterms and one Final 26% each. Homework and Participation 8%. Tax Return Project 14%. The lectures are very interesting. She does a great job of breaking down the ideas. She also does a great job of leaving out the unimportant information, but there still is quite a bit of detail that you go over. Homeworks are not graded based on whether you did them right, she is looking for effort. Homework is due every week, and it is important that you get that done. It makes the lectures more interesting, and it makes it so much easier once the finals come along. It is also important for participation points. She calls out individuals in class to answer tax problems. The tax project wasn't difficult, I think the class averaged a B+, just make sure to up with the homework. Her slides are extremely helpful for studying. Do NOT stick to the slides completely. They are an good outline. There are some parts where she doesn't go into detail on the slides, it is rare, but there were a few parts that this happened. She gives very good supporting notes and material. Very supportive in class and during her office hours. I don't think this class could have been taught much better than it was.

Great teacher.  I had her for Tax (Bus320) and this class is difficult but I think she did a good job.  She explains her PowerPoints well and does lots of practice problems.  Though her PowerPoints are outline format so it doesn't go super in-depth into some things which are important to know.  Her office hours are a must.  I actually wish I went more because every time I went, she was very helpful and would try to help you understand the material.

So with that being said, this class is extremely difficult.  A lot of students (including myself obviously) had a lot of trouble with this class.  Lots of memorization of exceptions, formulas, rules, etc.  She says it's important to know the reasoning behind everything, but it turns out more like straight-up memorization.  A lot of people I talked to who took this class already said it was their hardest class in all of accounting and I believe it.

Professor Bissonnette is a good teacher for this class and overall I would recommend her. Tax is a very time consuming and difficult class and when I took this class I didn't know that so this past quarter turned out to be pretty rough. But as far as what I wish I knew beforehand is to spend the most time studying her slides as they are almost everything you need to know (the book is large and has a lot of additional material that you don't need to know all the details), also do well on the tax project as she grades pretty hard, and lastly don't give up easy points and study several days in advance for the midterms (I would suggest going over the homework problems, slides, at least twice). I had a borderline grade in this class and studied a lot for the final (all of deadweek and the weekend before the Monday final) and I think it paid off.

Oh Bissonnette... What to say. 320 was a very informative class to say the very least. Bissonnette is a very sweet lady but she doesn't put up with any bullshit. She is very biased towards her CPAC kids and office hour hoggers. She has a masters in tax so tax is her baby. Do NOT expect this class to be easy whatsoever. She collects homework every class period and if you aren't in the group that turns their homework in then you better know your shit because you will get called on and she will make you answer and if you're wrong she will slightly help you come to the right answer. There are two midterms, very very very detailed and there is not nearly enough time to finish them and go back through to check your work in 2 hours. She is really horrible at coming up with multiple choice questions, she usually gives two answers that are correct but there is one that is more correct and even if you can prove that she's wrong she won't give you the points because she won't admit any fault when it comes to tax. She also corrects the book A LOT because she is all knowing so make sure that you go to lectures and PAY ATTENTION. Do NOT rely solely on the book for your information. There is also a partner tax return project that she acutally grades fairly nicely on. You will learn a lot from this class but it is not easy and it is not enjoyable. If you want to learn a lot with the possibility of doing horrible because of how she has everything weighted then take her class. If you want to learn the material AND do well take it with another professor. All in all though it was a good class, just the points were set up retardedly and she throws a lot of curve balls. She also expects you to learn how she did and her professors made them memorize every single thing. Get ready to give your life to tax with Bissonnette.

Bissonnette will be one of the hardest teacher's you can take for accounting.  She is a very nice lady and will teach slowly for students to understand, but her exams are extremely hard!! There are two midterms and 1 final and she still collects homework randomly.  She does not curve and will probably fail the whole class if she needs too.  The first midterm for Bus 321 is mostly review from what you learned in 214, however the class average was only a 70%.  She even makes review material really really hard.  The final is NOT cummulative but it is extremely difficult.  Her office hours are usually over crowded with her 214 students so it is hard to get one on one attention.  Overall i regret taking Bissonnette because her expectations are really high and even though she can present the material clearly, her exams are just too difficult for an intermediate accounting class.  She suggest studying from the CPA review book because she usually takes questions from there.  You decide.
