       " \"\\nComing in to the class I had heard some things about Snape; he grades hard, he gives long homework assignments, he's a death eater, etc., and I was pretty intimidated. While it is true that he is a hard professor, I've learned more in his class than any other chemistry class before. His teaching style is very unorthodox; most students were working on balancing equations and entropy while we were studying Polyjuice Potion. However, it all works in the end. I'd really struggled to make a liquid luck in my CHEM 124 class with Dr. Noyes, but Snape really worked with me until I could put it together. I did feel like he really played favorites in his class; there was this guy named Harry that he just kept obsessing over, and if I asked a question he would just hit me over the head with my textbook. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, he's a great professor; pretty hard and kind of a weird dude, but you really learn a lot in his class.\",\n",

His teaching style is very unorthodox; most students were working on balancing equations and entropy while we were studying Polyjuice Potion. However, it all works in the end. I'd really struggled to make a liquid luck in my CHEM 124 class with Dr. Noyes, but Snape really worked with me until I could put it together. I did feel like he really played favorites in his class; there was this guy named Harry that he just kept obsessing over, and if I asked a question he would just hit me over the head with my textbook. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, he's a great professor; pretty hard and kind of a weird dude, but you really learn a lot in his class.\",\n",
